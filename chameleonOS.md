# Chameleon OS (The Adaptive interface)

**The Pitch:** A fluid, generative portfolio that has no fixed "style." Instead, it is a shapeshifting interface that proves the designer's range by dynamically redesigning itself based on the user's intent
**The Twist:** **"The Vibe Slider."** Upon entry, the user is presented with a slider ranging from "Corporate/Safe" to "Experimental/Wild." As the user drags the slider, the entire site’s typography, color palette, and grid layout morph in real-time without reloading. It showcases the designer's ability to handle both strict business logic and creative chaos.
Tech Stack & Key Specs:
**Frontend:** Svelte or SolidJS (for high-performance reactivity).
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with extensive use of CSS Variables driven by JavaScript state.
**Animation:** Anime.js or Spring physics to handle the morphing of UI components (e.g., square buttons turning into blobs).
**Key Spec:** A "Design System" sidebar that logs the changes in real-time as the slider moves.
